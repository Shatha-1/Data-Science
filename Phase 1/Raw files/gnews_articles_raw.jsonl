This promotes viral attachment and entry into host cells by enabling multiple parallel interactions between viral HA and cell surface sialic acid. However, high densities of HA on the viral surface may also increase viral susceptibility to antibodies whose avidity is enhanced by the availability of multiple HA binding partners. We examined how the density of HA on the viral surface influences the binding of bivalent IgG antibodies that depend on engaging multiple HAs for robust attachment. Using fluorescence-based measurements on authentic and synthetic viruses, we find that reducing HA densities to 10% of their natural levels is not sufficient to disrupt antibody avidity. Additionally, we find that flexibility of the HA anchor may facilitate bivalent antibody binding by allowing HA to tilt relative to the membrane. These findings highlight how both the organization and dynamics of viral surface proteins can influence immune recognition and may inform strategies for antigen presentation in vaccine design.", "content": "Introduction\nInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics with global mortality in the hundreds of thousands to millions each year [1–4].
