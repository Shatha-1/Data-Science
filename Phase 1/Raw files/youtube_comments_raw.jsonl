Then I realized that mRNA vaccines would be the most effective method to counter future epidemics. Globalization has increased the likelihood of a quickly developing epidemic. mRNA vaccines can be designed and implemented quickly. As soon as the Covid vaccine was released, I received one, knowing full well that I was a test subject. In my opinion, I was a test subject for a good cause. My grandmother barely survived the 1918 flu; in her 90's, she still remembered it as the worst headache of her life. In my 40's, I lost hearing in my right ear because of a viral infection.  I have two friends who had long Covid; their recovery took years, not days or weeks. Viruses can cause permanent damage to your body. Patients who survived polio in later life have to contend with post-polio syndrome.\n\nWe need to support US public health efforts and medical research, both basic and applied.  Recent research suggests that getting the shingles vaccine may decrease the risk of dementia associated with aging.  Would you get vaccinated if there was evidence that it decreased your risk of cancer? \n\nWe need a trusted global disease monitoring network. Our systems aren't perfect, but they are better than the alternative.

However, let's be clear that nothing is perfect and there will always be that risk factor of adverse effects, low, but there is that possibility. Ultimately, the benefits outweigh the risks, and it will be my duty to educate my patients on how vaccines work. However, we do respect everyone's autonomous decision.

Eliminate consumption of junk food, alcohol and get some excercise! Surround yourself with positive people and laugh again! When not feeling well, lay down. Call in sick if you need to. Eat some bone broth and drink some hot tea with lemon and honey. Suck on some throat lozenges. Take a warm bath with epsom salt.", "likeCount": 0}

What was last year’s flu efficacy percentage period. A well designed study demonstrated that it had -27% efficacy. Now I’m not a fancy Schmanski doctor like you but negative efficacy sounds pretty bad. We know that it doesn’t stop transmission and if it’s -27% effective that means it’s causing people to get the flu. Now, if I’m 75 years old, diabetic hypertensive and history of coronary arteries disease getting the fucking flu doesn’t sound too good. So why would I take a vaccine that’s -27% effective.

Again if you don't believe it do a research of flu and ringing in the ears and deafness and watch hundreds of cases pop up. Then you got the preservatives that are put and again they keep changing them... so your research gets a lot more complicated. \nPutting adjuvants to the vaccine...and putting the immune system on overdrive's risks are unknown, specially on someone that has already a very strong immune system.

What you had were mild side effects, very normal. You're just confusing minor aches and pains with full on body aches and a small 99 fever with a 103 fever. Mild nausea with can't even stand the sight or smell of food for days, throwing up nonstop. You also might have picked up a completely separate virus or maybe you're waiting too long into the flu season to get the flu shot, not giving it a chance to actually protect you. No amount of \"I barely graduated high school but I can shout my opinion on the internet\" is going to convince anyone other than the same morons who already think like you. YOU COMMENTERS are the reason the healthcare system is failing, not the medical staff. You shout \"propaganda\" at everything without realizing, you have fallen for the biggest propaganda of all. You are literally the reason the movie Idiocracy will come true. Your descendants are going to the ones that think Gatorade is how you nourish plants.

That immune activation can cause side effects ranging from mild soreness and fatigue to more noticeable symptoms like fever. Supposedly, it’s not an actual illness—just your immune system “practicing”—but that explanation doesn’t always fully address the concerns people have about how their bodies react.", "likeCount": 0}

I want to just ☠️ ☠️ ☠️ at this point. \n\nIf anyone else has gone through this... please share. I would help me to not feel so alone. I've been to the doctor twice in one week and am going back again tomorrow. The last after hours doctor who saw me made me feel insane. I could visibly see he was frustrated and didn't believe me. Mind you, throughout my time here on earth , I have barely seen doctors except for routine visits so I'm not hysterical or a hypochondriact. I was perfectly fine and in good health previous to this shot. This is going into the third week now, symptoms have progressed . He prescribed a few medications that only made my ailments worse. Again, I do NOT blame him. Yes, I wish he would have been kinder but i do not think he is the culprit and I understand most doctors stand by the flu shot wholeheartedly.\n\nI've written a lot, I apologize but I really needed to get this out. Do you think this is coincidence or directly related? Thank you in advance...please be nice 🫣❤", "likeCount": 1}

It's heartbreaking that there are so many people who refuse to listen to reason on the topic, though.  I don't know that they ever will.

I may not have been dying but it sure felt like it.  Since that I've gotten the shot every year and have since been exposed to the flu twice.  Each time I had a very mild, short case.  That is one thing I don't often hear people talk about for some reason.  If you get vaccinated and still get the flu, your suffering should be a fraction of what it could have been if you were unvaccinated.  But even if it had zero benefit to me, how could I not get the flu shot knowing the risk of contracting it and passing it on to an older or otherwise vulnerable person?

Additionally, the data is non-linear, suggesting that vaccinated individuals are super-spreaders of COVID-19, who become dangerous to the whole community.    Nonetheless papers have been released claiming that taking the flu shot is protective against COVID.

I take colloidal silver which stops viral replication PERIOD.  It's antiviral, antibacterial and antifungus.  It's the most antimicrobial substance known to man. The best product to buy is sovereign silver because it is the smallest particle size, .8 nanometers and the purest silver 99.999 percent and pharmaceutical grade water when talking about purity here.  This translates into no Argyria or blue skin in its 19 year history it's safe and very effective.   Herd immunity doesn't exist and has never existed its false advertising.  Other natural and very effective medicines are oil of oregano and olive leaf very efficient at flu viruses.  Also increases the immune system something a flu shot can never do at all.  Also consuming cleaner foods like organic and making sure your getting lots of vitamin D as well something that fights flus as well.   It's about the law of the terrain not the germ theory PERIOD.  If your eating junk food and taxing your liver and gi tract your more succeptible to getting sick you don't get sick from having a healthy diet I fact I barely ever get sick now.

Meaning they read the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion.  They carefully scrutinize the data to see if there are any apparent flaws that jump out.  Then below the “discussion” (or “results” if there is no “discussion”) they take note at the references cited.  And wait... there’s more!  Then a researcher will read all the articles that each citation came from.  This again includes the abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and references.  They repeat this until they can verify beyond a shadow of a doubt that the accuracy of that first study that they read stands up to critique, and no flaws are identified.\n\nSo let’s go back to comparing Dr. Mike’s profession to a researchers.  Dr. Mike, a medical doctor,  is an applied science profession.  They take what the researchers publish and apply it in a narrow scope to their type of practice.  Whereas a researcher has a doctorate (Ph.d) in all the complex nuances and tiniest little details in their field.  They are truly experts in their respective fields.  \n\nNow let’s apply all this to Flu vaccines, and whether Dr. Mike is qualified and/or knowledgeable about all the complexities that go into creating any particular Flu vaccine.\n\nBased on the fact that Dr. Mike does not cite studies to substantiate any of his claims, let alone discuss (and provide sources) each individual ingredient in a given Flu vaccine, it is safe to say that he is simply regurgitating what he has been “taught” without subjecting it to multiple layers of scrutiny.  \n\nSimply put, Dr. Mike (and any other MD who doesn’t dive into the research) are in many ways no more than highly educated sales associates for the pharmaceutical industry.  And in all fairness, a practicing full time medical doctor likely does not have the time to dive into research in the same capacity a professional researcher would.  But let’s not pretend that it’s okay to spew out commercialized scripts about Flu vaccines, like Dr. Mike is doing.  \n\nAt the very least, he should recite a disclaimer in the beginning of this video (and every other video he’s made) that the information he provides is based on his frame of reference, and is in no way a substitution for carefully reading peer reviewed literature on each ingredient in the vaccine.  On the other end of the spectrum, if he wanted to be as accurate as possible, he should take this video down.\n\nTo all who are curious about whether or not the Flu vaccine is safe, I highly recommend reading peer reviewed studies on each individual ingredient that’s present in any given vaccine.  I would also highly recommend to research the sad history of accidental contaminations or various vaccine supplies.  Also research the role “cell lines” play in the creation and production of vaccines, and how inadvertent transmission of viruses from the animal tissue that cell lines are grown in occur more often than the government likes to admit.", "likeCount": 1}

The fact is - your body may have the wrong genetic code to respond to it.  After getting the vaccine - your body can take 2 weeks to respond.  The flu shot may help you.  If I could hear a confident statement like \"any flu vaccine taken by anyone in any year will reduce your risk of getting the flu or having a worse case scenario by 50%\" which is not what Dr Mike said.  I believe most seniors, most people of high risk probably already get a flu vaccine - BUT every year new strains of flu are shared so vaccines are still a hit and miss (unlike most the vaccines we give our children to wipe out things like tetanus, rubella, polio, TB, etc...).  No pharma company is fully invested in improving the flu vaccine UNTIL something like this nasty COVID-19 hits the fan because there is a big win for them (first to market profit and prominence in the industry).", "likeCount": 1}

Will masks help prevent you from getting the flu or simply from spreading it? \nQuestions like these and how they interlace with the current situation. Thank you:) keep doing u", "likeCount": 0}

They use to say you could develop symptoms that could last a week... now they admit it’s the flu but it wasn’t because of the shot.... There is to much to question, and the answers mean someone was lying at some point. I believe in vaccines, and I make sure up to date immunization are current in my house hold. But I believe the flu shot to be greedy business. Greedy, fear mongering business.", "likeCount": 0}

I have had the flu but very rarely so sick that would make me question my choice never to get it. I have found that many people I know who DO get the flu shot almost always get immediately sick and out from work!  I believe in my immune system for basic colds, flus, bronchitis, and phnemonia. I’ve had them all and always thank God handled it just fine! I have had covid twice and handled it just fine again Thank God. Vaccinations should always always be the choice of the person never forced! My decision, my consequences should there be any. Also side note!!!! The two times I got COVID I later found it was after dining at a table with family members who DID get vaccinated for COVID. Within the next 3-5 days guess who got COVID! I believe (my opinion) that the vaccines are what caused the mass spread of COVID. Think about it in the past prior to Covid they said a lot of deaths were mainly because of the flu so therefore everyone would get the flu vaccine however, during Covid, you hardly ever heard the flu or that anyone was sick from the flu because the Covid symptoms were very similar or people who had the flu were told they had Covid, which then skewed the numbers for actually how many people really had Covid? This is just my opinion. I don’t have any documentation just my own observations and experiences so please no haters. We are all individuals and responsible for our own selves and own decisions by myself Choose most often to let my immune system handle things. That is my choice. The only reason we’re hearing more and more about the flu again is because less than less people are wanting to take the Covid shots whatever your decision is for you you do what you think is right for you And people need to let people just be. I did not keep my kids during Covid. They all sat in their own cars in a circle and respected each other space while still having communication and socializing where human beings we need to socialize that was the worst thing that they could’ve done was tell everybody to stay alone at home and not go out. My children, thank God we’re also fine. Each person is responsible for the decisions they make in the things they do if you’re given a guideline tweak it to what works for you. You don’t have to do it exactly the way someone else says because that’s what worked for them. We were told not to get too close to people we didn’t we still socialized we adhere to the 6 feet aside from at the dinner table, which is when I got it for the holidays from a family member who is vaccinated that day. For all the people that I socialized with that weren’t vaccinated at the time of being in their company. I never got sick so doctor Dhand; I agree with and believe you. ❤️🙏", "likeCount": 0}

I tried taking flu vaccines for 2 years while I was working because I was around the public and every year that I took the jab I got deathly sick for weeks and more than once during the cold season. When I stopped after a couple of years of taking I didn’t get sick , now when COVID came around in 2019 my wife and got really sick I even woke up out of a deep sleep gasping for air then got antibiotics and got better. In 2021 my wife and I got sick again never got the COVID vaccine took antibiotics again my wife didn’t take her antibiotics and ended up in the hospital. I got us both tested for COVID it came back negative before she entered the hospital. When she entered the hospital the were diagnosing COVID, tested her it came back negative they put her in the COVID section of the hospital, I fought for a private room and got it for her, hospital tested her again for COVID it came back negative but they were continuing to treat her for COVID and she died after 2 months in the hospital, the doctor had come to me before she died and declared she had COVID antibodies in her blood and I replied “ didn’t the W.H.O. Say that the body only remembers the COVID antibodies for 8 months then tell me why thats true when my wife and I had COVID in 2019 and you are finding antibodies in her blood in 2021 “ the doctor was lost for words and couldn’t answer. God created the human body to heal itself and to adjust, adapt and defend against natural and unnatural illnesses. I that to be true but still a little help is sometimes needed not someone trying to play god and creating illnesses thinking it’s a cure", "likeCount": 0}

You can do some strength training, sleep with your window cracked every night even in the winter (just cover the windows with big drapes and wear cozy PJs and dense blankets. Air out your sheets every morning by pulling them back and wash them at least 1-2x per week including your comforter!!!

It is so important that medical professionals speak up.  I worked with an Allergist who wanted me to get the whooping cough jab in 2015. I told him I would just do what I always do and rely on natural remedies, steam myself etc.  The Doctor, his wife and daughter all got it and very shortly the Doctor his wife and daughter started coughing a very distinct cough...I asked him \"Is that a whooping cough?\"  The look on his face went from a look of shock, to confusion, then angry and denial.  He said no and stomped away.  Over the next 5 weeks he coughed all around patients to boot.  \n\nI did end up with a bit of the cough right after he was initially sick but only for 5 days over the weekend and I didn't miss any work, even with my lowered immune system.  A few weeks later, I ended up with Bell's Palsy.  I got that due to his shedding, unfortunately my whole system eventually had enough.  I was diagnosed with Mastocytosis.  I was never able to work after that  I never go the jab during the Plandemic and have never had a flu shot.  My son's girlfriend who was one of the radical people has been sick frequently since her multiple shots and sadly my grandson who was a very healthy baby is now frequently sick since she started him on the flu ones...yet she keeps doubling down.  \n\nI have a senior friend who is in her mid 80's she could dance circles around me until her Doctor pushed her to get the flu shot.  That was about 5 year ago and ever since she has been getting the flu.  She argues with me now and tells me it isn't the shot...but her memory that was so excellent for so long has deteriorated very suddenly.  It's heart breaking.  \n\nSad that pride is over ruling common sense.  We have been on this planet for a very long time and if Harmaceuticals were working we'd all be very healthy!  Sadly that is not the case.  I keep praying more and more people wake up!  Sending Hugs from little O'l me :)", "likeCount": 1}
