Study 1: Examining the Negative Sentiments Related to Influenza VaccinationExamining the Negative Sentiments Related to Influenza Vaccination

Problem addressed:
This study aimed to investigate the negative public sentiments toward influenza vaccination and understand the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy, especially the role of misinformation and distrust in vaccination policies.

Dataset used:
The study used unstructured textual data collected from Twitter. A total of 261,613 English tweets related to influenza vaccination were analyzed, covering the period from 2017 to 2022.

Method / Model:
Deep learning techniques were applied for sentiment analysis. The authors used BERT-based models to classify tweets by sentiment and employed topic modeling (BERTopic) to identify major themes within negative sentiments.

Key results:
The results showed a significant increase in negative sentiments toward influenza vaccination after 2020. Most negative opinions were related to distrust in government vaccination policies and the spread of misinformation, 
particularly influenced by discussions surrounding COVID-19 vaccines.





Study 2: Examining Public Messaging on Influenza Vaccine over Social Media

Problem addressed:
This study investigated how organizations communicate about influenza vaccination on social media, aiming to understand the focus and limitations of current public messaging and its potential influence on vaccine uptake.

Dataset used:
The study analyzed unstructured textual data from Twitter, consisting of 235,261 English tweets posted by organizational accounts between 2017 and 2023. Tweets were collected using the Twitter API and filtered to exclude individual users, duplicates, and non-English posts.

Method / Model:
An unsupervised deep learning approach was applied. The authors used BERT-based topic modeling (BERTopic) to identify major themes in organizational tweets related to influenza vaccination.

Key results:
The analysis identified four main topics: (1) vaccination campaigns, (2) safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, (3) appropriate age for vaccination, and (4) importance of vaccination during pregnancy. While no major misinformation was detected, the findings showed that public messaging had a limited scope, suggesting missed opportunities to better address capability, opportunity, and motivation factors that could improve vaccination uptake.





Study3: Examining Public Sentiments and Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccination

Problem addressed:
This study aimed to examine public sentiments and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination by analyzing discussions on Twitter. The researchers focused on understanding vaccine hesitancy, opinions about vaccine mandates, and public reactions to vaccination experiences.

Dataset used:
The study analyzed unstructured textual data collected from Twitter. A total of 2,944,530 English tweets posted by 1,210,225 individuals between January 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021 were included in the final analysis. Tweets made by organizations and news outlets were excluded to focus only on individual users.

Method / Model:
The researchers used topic modeling (CorEx) to identify major themes and topics within the tweets. They also applied VADER sentiment analysis to measure positive, negative, and neutral sentiments over time. Data preprocessing steps included removing duplicates, stop words, and separating individual accounts from organizational accounts using a machine learning classifier.

Key results:
The analysis identified 16 topics grouped into six main themes, including vaccination policies, vaccine hesitancy, post-vaccination side effects, vaccine development and distribution, public attitudes, and gratitude toward healthcare workers.
The most discussed topics were vaccine mandates (mandatory vs optional), vaccine hesitancy, and post-vaccination side effects.
Overall, positive sentiment was higher than negative sentiment; however, topics such as vaccine hesitancy and conspiracy theories showed consistently negative sentiments.




Study 4: Health Decision-Making Preferences and Influenza Vaccination

Problem addressed:
This study aimed to examine how individuals’ health decision-making preferences influence their attitudes toward influenza vaccination, particularly vaccine confidence, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination behavior.

Dataset used:
The study used survey data collected from two nationally representative samples of U.S. adults in 2016 and 2018. The total sample included 1005 participants in 2016 and 1020 participants in 2018.

Method / Model:
The researchers developed a measure of health decision-making preferences based on three dimensions: naturalist vs. technologist, doubter vs. believer, and minimalist vs. maximalist. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis was applied to examine the relationship between these preferences and vaccination attitudes and behavior.

Key results:
The results showed that individuals who preferred science-based medicine, trusted healthcare professionals, and favored proactive medical intervention had higher vaccine confidence and lower vaccine hesitancy. Physician recommendation was also identified as a strong predictor of influenza vaccination intention and behavior.







Study 5: Examining Perceptions about Mandatory Influenza Vaccination of Healthcare Workers

Problem addressed:
This study aimed to examine public perceptions regarding mandatory influenza vaccination policies for healthcare workers, particularly the “vaccinate or wear a mask” policy implemented in British Columbia, Canada. The researchers focused on understanding public attitudes, concerns, and levels of support for mandatory vaccination policies.

Dataset used:
The study analyzed unstructured textual data collected from online comments posted on Canadian news websites. A total of 1,163 comments written by 648 individuals were analyzed, in response to 36 news articles published between August 2012 and May 2013.

Method / Model:
The researchers applied thematic qualitative analysis to categorize and identify key themes within the comments. Sentiment toward influenza vaccines and support for mandatory vaccination policies were also classified as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed.

Key results:
The results showed that 48% of commenters expressed negative sentiment toward influenza vaccines, and 75% did not support the mandatory vaccination policy. The most common themes included concerns about freedom of choice, vaccine effectiveness, distrust in government and pharmaceutical companies, and vaccine safety.
